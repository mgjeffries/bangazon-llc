# Token Authentication with DRF

Tokens are used by a server its clients so that each client can be uniquely identified. For your application, when a user fills out the registration form, the following process occurs.

1. Client sends a request to the server's `/register` route with the user's information in the body of the request.
1. Server extracts all of the information from the request and stores it in Python variables.
1. A record in the `User` table is created.
1. A record in the `Gamers` table is created.
1. A new token is generated for the client. This token is unique for that user.
1. The token is sent back to the client so that it can be used on future requests to identify the user. This way, the user doesn't have to keep filling out their username and password each time a new action is performed.

## Login and Register Functions

Create the following module in your API application. It is commented, so please read the logic once you have it created.

> #### `levelup/levelupapi/views/auth.py`

```py
import json
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.contrib.auth import login, authenticate
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from rest_framework.authtoken.models import Token
from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt
from levelupapi.models import Gamer


@csrf_exempt
def login_user(request):
    '''Handles the authentication of a gamer

    Method arguments:
      request -- The full HTTP request object
    '''

    req_body = json.loads(request.body.decode())

    # If the request is a HTTP POST, try to pull out the relevant information.
    if request.method == 'POST':

        # Use the built-in authenticate method to verify
        username = req_body['username']
        password = req_body['password']
        authenticated_user = authenticate(username=username, password=password)

        # If authentication was successful, respond with their token
        if authenticated_user is not None:
            token = Token.objects.get(user=authenticated_user)
            data = json.dumps({"valid": True, "token": token.key})
            return HttpResponse(data, content_type='application/json')

        else:
            # Bad login details were provided. So we can't log the user in.
            data = json.dumps({"valid": False})
            return HttpResponse(data, content_type='application/json')


@csrf_exempt
def register_user(request):
    '''Handles the creation of a new gamer for authentication

    Method arguments:
      request -- The full HTTP request object
    '''

    # Load the JSON string of the request body into a dict
    req_body = json.loads(request.body.decode())

    # Create a new user by invoking the `create_user` helper method
    # on Django's built-in User model
    new_user = User.objects.create_user(
        username=req_body['username'],
        email=req_body['email'],
        password=req_body['password'],
        first_name=req_body['first_name'],
        last_name=req_body['last_name']
    )

    # Now save the extra info in the levelupapi_gamer table
    gamer = Gamer.objects.create(
        bio=req_body['bio'],
        user=new_user
    )

    # Commit the user to the database by saving it
    gamer.save()

    # Use the REST Framework's token generator on the new user account
    token = Token.objects.create(user=new_user)

    # Return the token to the client
    data = json.dumps({"token": token.key})
    return HttpResponse(data, content_type='application/json')
```

## Auth Package Imports

The `auth` directory is going to become a package so that other modules can import the functions. Create the `views/__init__.py` file and place the following code in it.

```py
from .auth import login_user
from .auth import register_user
```

## Using Auth Package Views to Make Routes

The last step is to establish some URL routes that any client application can use to register and login a gamer to use the API.

Completely replace the contents of the following file with the code below.

> #### `levelup/levelup/urls.py`

```py
from django.conf.urls import include
from django.urls import path
from levelupapi.views import register_user, login_user

urlpatterns = [
    path('register', register_user),
    path('login', login_user),
    path('api-auth', include('rest_framework.urls', namespace='rest_framework')),
]
```

In the code above, you will notice that the `register_user` and `login_user` functions are imported into the module. Then they are used to map a route to that view

```py
# Requests to http://localhost:8000/register will be routed to the register_user function
path('register', register_user)
# Requests to http://localhost:8000/login will be routed to the login_user function
path('login', register_user)
```

## Authenticating a User

Now you can test this out as an actual Gamer who would be using the application. Launch your initial React client, and try to log in with the account that was created with your fixtures.

You will need to start the django server:
```
python manage.py runserver
```

Username is `me@me.com`

Password is `me`

Verify that you can log in and that the logout link takes you back to the log in screen.
